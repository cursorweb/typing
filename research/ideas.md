# Random
Random ideas that have come to mind
Look ahead (current word is hidden)
Blind (only see current and next 2 words)
Instant death -- as soon as you type a wrong character the whole test restarts
Chinese?? Obviously accuracy doesn't mean anything...
Individual word mode: Type an individual word as fast as possible
Guided Warmup: A selection of warmups to do.

* split css into multiple files
* load the test data as maybe json?
* HEY ARE WE GOING TO DO REACT??????
* some how add good component system (for pages etc)
* maybe split tynput up to be more modular
* typing test where you 'review' monkeytype words
    * do the words, then repeat the incorrect words before moving on
    * other kinds of infinite tests

## Organization
* Method to favorite
* There will be a tag system, and you can toggle tests between dvorak mode and qwerty
* You can also search for tests

## A note on terminology
Each *mode* has one or more *tests*.
*Pacers*, and *Warmups* are modes because they contain special properties aside from *tests*. *Pacers* focus on WPM, etc. and *warmups* contain multiple tests.
